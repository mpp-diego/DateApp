##Profiling automation TODO:

Build a small iOS application that writes the Date() when it was opened.
The app appends this date to a file date_log.txt in the Documents folder of the app.
The app should use this bundle identifier com.mypinpad.experiment.document-access.
The app has to be installed on a real iOS device via AdHoc distribution.

1. Can we download the date_log.txt from the device using a command line tool?
2. Can we install an .ipa of the app to the real device using a command line tool?
